    - "How did you feel at that point?"
    - "Where did you notice that in your body?"
    - "What was the intensity (1-10)?"
    
  depth_check: |
    Is there more to explore here, or does this feel complete?
    
  encouragement:
    - "Take your time with this."
    - "There's no rush to conclude."
    - "Let's sit with that for a moment."
